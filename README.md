# HitGuess

Simple clone of the HitSter game in which players guess a song, its artist and the year of release. It accepts an arbitrary Spotify playlist and generates game cards from them with a QR code to the Spotify song.

This means that you can make a lot of variations for different kind of audiences. Want to play with your kpop loving friends? Generate a card game with a kpop playlist! Want to keep it at the more general hits? Use the default Dutch playlist.

## Running

Be sure to install the dependencies with `poetry` and run `python3 hitguess/main.py [playlist_id]`

## Remarks

Developed this rather fast and dirty. The HTML does not print that well currently.
